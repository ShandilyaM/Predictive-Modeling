# Predictive Modeling for Heart Disease Prediction

# Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to construct a predictive model that can accurately 
identify individuals at risk of developing heart disease based on their lifestyle factors and 
behavioral patterns. By leveraging data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 
(BRFSS) survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the 
United States, we seek to uncover the most influential factors contributing to the risk of heart 
disease

Importance of the Problem:
Cardiovascular diseases are top causes of death globally, striking many people in their mid-30s 
to 40s. An effective predictive model for heart disease can lead to early treatments that save 
lives. A model with high recall is crucial to not miss any at-risk individuals, helping to decrease 
the rate of cardiovascular diseases and deaths.

Data Source:
Analysis uses 2015 CDC BRFSS survey data. 229,787 non-heart disease individuals were 
studied. Behavior and lifestyle data help prediction systems. 

Evaluation Metrics:
The project's metric is accuracy. Our objective is a lifestyle and behavioral prediction tool that 
detects heart disease risk at 90% or higher. We hope to solve this challenge and create an 
accurate prediction system to reduce heart disease and promote public health. Early heart disease 
prevention may benefit individuals, families, and healthcare systems.
